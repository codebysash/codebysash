👋 Hi, I'm Sash (aka codebysash)
I'm a developer based in Brisbane, Queensland, Australia 🇦🇺
Currently 100% focused on mastering deep learning through fast.ai and building meaningful AI applications that solve real-world problems.

🎯 Current Mission: Fast.ai Mastery
Primary focus - learning and building:

🤖 Fast.ai Deep Learning Course - Building production-ready classifiers
🦿 Prosthetic Device AI - Image classification for medical devices (personal passion project)
🧪 Materials Science AI - Nanotube quality control applications
📚 Python for Data Analysis - Mastering the data science stack


📈 Learning Progress (Day 3)

✅ Chapter 1: Image classification fundamentals mastered
✅ Bird Classifier: Built solo from scratch
🎯 Bear Classifier: 3-category classification (in progress)
🎯 Prosthetic Classifier: Breakthrough project (coming soon)


🔬 Projects in Development:

Fast.ai Journey - Complete learning documentation
Prosthetic Classification System - AI for medical device identification
BNNT Quality Control - Materials science applications


💡 Philosophy:
Deep focus on meaningful AI applications. Always learning, always building.
Open to internship opportunities where I can apply and expand my AI/ML skills while contributing to impactful projects.
